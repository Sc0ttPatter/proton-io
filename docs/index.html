							Proton-io builder is an interface that allows you to create scripts for proton-io without writing the interface.json file manually. Learn more about  <a href="#interface-json">interface.json</a>.<br>
							You can access the Builder by right clicking the proton-io tray icon to reveal the menu and then select 'Builder'.
						</p>
						<img src="assets/images/docs/builder_general.jpg">
						<p>
							<strong>Proton type : </strong> Here you can choose weather the script you're about to create is gonna have parameters for the user or not. <br>
							<strong>Proton name : </strong>This is the name of your script, the same name it will appear with in the menu. <br>
							<strong>Proton category : </strong> Here you can write the category in which this script will belong to, giving it a new category will create one automatically in the menu. <br>
							<strong>Get current directory : </strong> If this is checked, the command you give in this script will have the active directory as an argument. <br>
							<strong>Get selected files : </strong> Same as 'Get current directory' except this one will give the path of a selectedFiles.txt file that containes the selected file paths. <br>

							<strong>Proton Script : </strong> An executable, command or even a path to a script that will make use of the user parameters to perform the desired task. You can also use './' in the path which will be replaced to the script interface directory. <br>
							<strong>Proton process : </strong> The process that will run your script (ex : python executable). <br>
							<strong>Author : </strong> The author name, which will be displayed when a user clicks the question mark '?' in a script parameter window. <br>
							<strong>Version : </strong> To version your script. <br>
							<strong> Description : </strong> A description of the script, same as the Author, it will be displayed upon clicking the question mark in the parameters window and on mouse over proton name in the menu and in <a href="#manager">Manager</a>. <br>
							<strong>inputs : </strong>You can choose an input type to add to your parameteric script by clicking the <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-plusthick"></span> icon. these are the available input types :

						<img src="assets/images/docs/builder_parameters.jpg">
						<ul id = "input-types" class="less-line-height">
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>inputField : </strong> A basic text field to input any kind of value.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>inputFilePath : </strong> A text field which has a button to browse file paths.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>inputdirectoryPath : </strong> A text field which has a button to browse and choose a directory.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>inputCheckbox : </strong> A basic checkbox input that will output either a 'true' or a 'false' statement.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>inputList : </strong> Generates a Drop down list, the list values can be separated with a comma ','.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>inputSlider : </strong> Generates a slider with a defined minimum and maximum values and also the step count.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>inputcolor : </strong> Generates a color pick input.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							All these inputs require to be given a name, and each name needs to be unique, some input types require other things for example inputList requires that you give it list of values separated by a comma, and slider input needs you to specify for it a min and a max value. all inputs can be given default values and a description. The description appears when the user puts the mouse over the input title. And the inputs can be previewed anytime by clicking 'Interface preview'. And 'Command preview' will show what they'll excute by default. You can also delete <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-trash"></span>, revert <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-arrowreturnthick-1-w"></span>, and change the order <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-arrowthick-2-n-s"></span> of the inputs.
						</p>
						<img src="assets/images/docs/builder_buttons.jpg">
						<p>
							<strong>Save : </strong> To save the script you just created. <br>
							<strong>Interface preview : </strong> This shows you a preview of the window that is generated by the script, this is intended for scripts that have user inputs, but it can also be useful for direct ones to test and debug them. <br>
							<strong>Command Preview : </strong> To quickly display the actual command that will be executed. <br>
							<strong>Clear all : </strong> To quickly clear all the inputs in the interface. <br>

						<strong>Param hotkey : </strong> The hotkey that will open the parameters window of the script, you'll notice some scripts have 'n/a' in this column, that's because those are direct execution scripts that don't have parameters to be set by the user, so those have a direct hotkey only.<br>
						<strong>Direct hotkey : </strong> The hotkey to directly execute the script in its default parameters.<br>
						<strong>Remove : </strong> to select the scripts that you want to be removed, the removal will happen only after saving, and a confirmation message will be given after clicking 'Save' when some scripts are checked to be deleted..<br>

						<h3>Make a proton-io script</h3>
						<p>
							This works for any executables or any command/script from any launguage, be it batch, python, node.js etc...<br>
							The idea basically is taking arguments from proton-io such as the selected files paths, the active directory and even other user input values from the parameters window. <br>
							First let's create the <a href="#interface-json">interface.json</a> for our script, this allows proton-io to understand the nature of your script and how it'll use it etc....<br>
							Luckily for us we have <a href="#builder">Builder</a> which allows us to create that easily. So just right click the tray icon of proton-io and select <a href="#builder">Builder</a>.
						</p>

						<img src="assets/images/docs/tutorial_01.jpg">
						<p>
							Ok let's see what's happening here, we just made a script named 'CommandPrompt_here', we checked 'Get current directory' so it will receive the path to the active directory as an argument, the script is a simple command <code>cmd /k cd /d</code> that opens the command line prompt in the path that comes after <code>/d</code>, in our case it will always be the active directory since we checked it above to act as an argument. <br>
							Opening command prompt in the current directory...Well this can already be achieved using windows context menu right? <br>
							So let's see what else we can do with proton-io. First, instead of launching the script by selecting it in the menu, you can instead directly execute it with a hotkey of your choice, you can give it a hotkey using <a href="#manager">Manager</a>. This is for now the fastest way you can use proton-io scripts <br>
							But what if we want to give our script parameters? This is another thing windows context menu doesn't offer, let's see how we can do that using proton-io in the next tutorial.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Make a script with parameters</h3>
						<p>
							Having the possibility to input parameters for your scripts before execution opens doors for a lot more scripting tasks and solutions.
						</p>
						<img src="assets/images/docs/tutorial_02.jpg">
						<p>
							This script's purpose is simply being able to rename the currently selected files in the explorer by search and replace. <br>
							So the idea is to get the currently selected files paths, a search input and a replace input, and then handle all that in a command that would rename those files accordingly. <br>
							While creating the <a href="#interface-json">interface.json</a> for this script, we want to make sure we check the 'Get selected files' that will give us the selected file paths as an argument, and also add some input fields for the user to type in what string to search and what string to be replaced with. <br>
							After that all we need is prepare a script that would handle those arguments and do the task we want. <br>
							This can be done in any launguage but for me the easiest is python. So I specified an <code>exec.py</code> file to execute with 'python' as the process. <br>
						</p>
						<p class="tips-content">
							<strong class="tips" id ="#tip-4">Tip #4 : </strong> The <code>./</code> in 'Proton Script' will be replaced with the script's <a href="#interface-json">interface.json</a> path, this way you can keep your script relative to where <a href="#interface-json">interface.json</a> is.<br>
							<strong class="tips" id ="#tip-4">Tip #5 : </strong> By typing only 'python' in the 'Proton Process'. the python exe that comes with proton-io will be used which is v2.7.14. You can give it a full path if you want to use another python exe.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is how the automatically generated interface looks like :
						</p>
						<img src="assets/images/docs/tutorial_04.jpg">
						<p>
							This is how my <code>exec.py</code> script file looks like.
						</p>
						<img src="assets/images/docs/tutorial_03.jpg">
						<p>
							As expected, the script takes the 4 arguments given by proton-io (including the script path itself). <br>
							Notice how I read <code>mySel</code> as a file. that's because proton-io sends the path to a <code>selectedFiles.txt</code> file that contains the list of the selected file paths. I avoid sending the array of file paths directly from proton-io because it can get too large for the command line to take.

					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>My name is Mohamed Oumoumad, I'm a CG artist. This all started as
						an experimental project to try to make a solution that would offer
						more than what windows context menu does. <br>
						Proton-io now gives the possibility to not only easily access any
						command, but also the ability to give it UI parameters
						and hotkeys. <br>
						Hopefully more people will find this useful same as I do, and I'm
						looking forward to get your feedback and contribution. <br>
						My ambition is to eventually start a common repository where people
						can share scripts that can be easily installed within proton-io.
